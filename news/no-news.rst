In the past, I've usually attempted to get out a release on or around
November 2nd, to commemorate the open source release of Ares.  However,
that's not happening this year (despite the fact that I suggested to
some people that I might have a release out by several months ago).

There's a simple reason: I changed jobs and countries earlier in the
year, and have yet to find the time or energy.  I still hope to get out
a release before too long (there's a `long list`_ of things fixed), but
I wouldn't count on it soon.
