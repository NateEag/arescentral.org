1997-08-12 `Ares 1.0 Demo`_
---------------------------

From the Info-Mac Digest, *"Ares Demo 1.0; a networkable tactical space
game":*

| Ares is a action/strategy fusion set in space. The player controls an
| individual ship as in traditional space-shooters, but also has the
| ability to construct and direct additional ships. It's a little like a
| cross between Blizzard's WarCraft and Accolade's StarControl.
|
| Ares has head-to-head network play over LocalTalk or over the internet.
|
| Ares also has a unique dynamic scaling engine, which smoothly changes
| from long-range tactical symbols to large colorful sprites for combat --
| you have to see it to believe it.
|
| Get the demo and see for yourself why Inside Mac Games said "this game is
| going to be hot!"

1998-??-?? Ares 1.0 (Changeling release)
----------------------------------------

From Changeling Software, *"ARES RELEASED!!!":*

    **Changeling** would like to thank all of you for your extreme
    patience and, more importantly, your enthusiasm. After more than 3
    long years of work, **Ares** has now been officially released.

    We intend to bring you the highest quality games possible, and
    continue to be completely committed to the **MacOS™** platform. In
    that spirit, we are sure that you will agree that **Ares**
    represents a truly unique experience in gaming.

    **Ares** is a groundbreaking game. Developed by **Nathan Lamont**, a
    Master of game design, **Ares** represents over 3 years of focused
    effort on the part of its designer. **Nathan** is responsible for
    every aspect of the game. He singlehandedly developed the story and
    concept of the game, created the 3D models used for the sprites,
    cut-scene movies, and interface, created the movies, developed the
    game engine and wrote all of the code in the game, in addition to
    composing the music. The few exceptions in the game that were not
    created by **Nathan** himself were created by none other than
    **Reginald Dujour**, who created the artwork for **Marathon**, and
    is currently creating the art for **Dark Vengeance** for **Reality
    Bytes**. All in all, **Ares** is a monumental work created by an
    exceptional individual who deserves a place in the Developer's Hall
    of Fame.

    The response from our beta testers, and those folks who placed
    pre-orders, and thus had the opportunity for early purchase, has
    been overwhelming.

    **Ares** is one of the most anticipated games for the **MacOS™**,
    and we believe that the game will meet or exceed your expectations.
    Get Ares now!!!

1999-09-30 `Ares 1.1.0`_ (Initial `Ambrosia Software`_ release)
---------------------------------------------------------------

From the Ambrosia Times, *"Ambrosia Software Re-releases Ares: Space
Action and Strategy Extravaganza!":*

    **Rochester, NY – September 30, 1999** – "OK, pilots, here's the
    plan," you say into the communicator, as you eye your shipboard
    computer. "The Gators have a base on that distant planet to the
    galactic south. It's defended by a fleet of about 15 ships, plus a
    flak drone."

    Your speech is interrupted by the sound of ships slowing from
    super-light speeds. It is a wing of Gaitori cruisers, and they've
    stopped right in the middle of your fleet! The night sky is lit up
    with the rays from 30 of your ships' photokinetic beam cannons. Half
    of the intruders leave just as quickly as they came; the others now
    bear a striking resemblance to space debris. Fragments of Gaitori's
    finest technology pelt your windshield, reminding you of hailstorms
    back on Earth.

    Unfortunately, a mission briefing is not the time for nostalgia.
    After a quick damage report, you continue relating the plans. Blue
    group will create a diversion away from the planet, and hopefully
    draw away some of the defenders. Green group will escort the
    engineers to the drone. If Green can take it, Blue and Green will
    converge at the drone and defend it until reinforcements can arrive.

    Your comrades slide into formation, and prepare for battle. They're
    doing remarkably well for folks who only started seeing
    intergalactic action yesterday. You smile to yourself, until you
    realize that you've probably just spoken to some of these guys for
    the last time. How many of them will live to see Earth again? The
    question races through your mind as you enter lightspeed, with the
    rest of Blue group in pursuit. The thought will have to be tabled –
    in an instant, you'll find out whether your RADAR was right about
    those 15 defenders.

    Ares is an exciting blend of action and strategy in uncharted space.
    Use your ships to control and protect planets, increase your
    manufacturing capacity, and fuel your war machine. A shrewd pilot
    with limited resources can decisively outwit a stronger opponent, so
    planning and execution are critical. Strategy outmatches guns any
    day in this game.

    Start with simple patrol missions, and work your way up to planetary
    invasions. Capture and hold strategic points, or your victory will
    be more costly! Send a swarm of ships to engulf the enemy, or
    sacrifice a lone fighter to draw them into a trap! No technique is
    too unconventional in your quest to recapture your home planet.

    Ares' developer, Nathan Lamont, has crafted an exciting universe
    with 20 strategic missions for a single player to accomplish. But
    the fun doesn't stop there! Two players can go head-to-head via
    AppleTalk or the Internet. Ares even sports integration with Scott
    Kevill's GameRanger_ service, so finding an opponent should be a
    snap.

    Another new feature is the addition of three in-depth tutorial
    levels to ease you into the commander's chair, explain basic
    tactics, and teach game controls. Absorb the knowledge, and use it
    to spank the oppressors. Ignore it, and go home disintegrated.

    Ares requires any 68040 or Power Macintosh computer with MacOS 7.5.3
    or later, a 13" color monitor, and 6 MB of free RAM. Ares has a
    registration fee of $25.


..  _v1-1-1:

1999-10-19 Ares 1.1.1 (Bug fix release)
---------------------------------------

Changes:

*   Demo couldnt be stopped if pause key (caps lock) was down; demo now
    pauses if pause key is down
*   While entering message, hitting transfer control key would still
    transfer control; this will no longer happen
*   Version 1.0 preferences werent accounted for; now if version 1.0
    preferences are present, the keys will revert to the defaults
*   It was possible to escape the boundaries of the playing area by
    nuzzling into a corner; this is no longer possible
*   In some net levels, the all-your-ships have died message wasnt
    displayed if you lost all your ships, likewise if your opponent lost
    all his ships, and both players would simply be presented with an
    empty screen; this has been fixed
*   In Make Way the planets were incorrectly named; they are now
    correctly named Fansi Alpha and Beta
*   When a slow computer and a fast computer tried to start a smaller
    net game for the second time, it was possible that after the level
    was loaded both computers would be stuck on a Waiting for Other
    Player message; this has been fixed
*   Networking may not have worked on pre-MacOS 8 68K systems. Installer
    now installs required components for NetSprocket on pre-MacOS 8
    systems with OpenTransport.
*   Some system enhancements, such as Boomerang, may have interfered
    with Ares' opening of its data files; Ares is now more compatible
    with such enhancements


..  _v1-2-0:

2001-04-10 `Ares 1.2.0`_ (Hera release)
---------------------------------------

From the Ambrosia Times, *"Ambrosia Software, Inc. releases Ares 1.2.0 &
scenario editor":*

    **Rochester, NY – April 12, 2001 –** Ambrosia Software, Inc.
    announced today the release version 1.2.0 of Ares, the tactical
    Inter-networkable space battle game that gives new meaning to the
    word "shrapnel."

    Ares 1.2.0 now includes Hera, a full-fledged scenario editor for
    Ares! Now you can modify Ares' built in scenarios, play scenarios
    made by other Ares fans, or even create your own custom scenarios
    for Ares! The universe is limited only by your imagination! Oh, and
    did we mention that this upgrade (as well as Hera) is entirely FREE
    for registered users of Ares?

    "Sure, Ares is an older game" says Ambrosia's el Presidente, Andrew
    Welch "However, it still kicks ass, especially for net play – and
    now that we've unleashed a scenario editor on the creative hordes of
    Ares addicts, we expect to see Ares live on for quite some time with
    new and interesting user-created scenarios. See you on GameRanger!"
