Antares 0.8.0 has been released.  This release runs on Mac OS X 10.9+
and, for the first time, Linux.  For the time being, Linux users will
need to `build from source`_.

*   Download `Antares 0.8.0 for Mac OS X 10.9+`_.
*   Download the `Antares 0.8.0 sources`_.

Aside from the addition of Linux support, Mac users with Retina displays
will notice some graphical improvements (limited for the time being to
windowed mode).

Note: there is a known issue in this release relating to dual-GPU
MacBooks.  For reasons that are still under investigation, performance
is very bad when using the dedicated Nvidia GPU.  You can use a program
such as gfxCardStatus_ to run on integrated graphics instead.
