`Antares 0.5.1`_ has been released. This release fixes several issues:

* Issue 7 (Add support for plugins)
* Issue 22 (Allow selection of screen size)
* Issue 95 (Cache digest of extracted scenario)
* Issue 103 (Text not drawn in bottom row of pixels on screen.)

Obviously, the main point of interest is the new support for plugins. In
order to demonstrate this feature, we've converted `Footsteps of
Pyrrhus`_ to work in Antares.  Work is underway to ensure full
interoperability between Antares and `Athena`_.

(What happened to 0.5.0? It had a crashing bug for users that tried to
load a plugin without first playing the factory scenario. The release
was scrapped in favor of 0.5.1)
