`Antares 0.7.1`_ has been released for Mac OS X 10.8+.  This is a hotfix
release fixing two issues:

* Issue 136 (No way to target self with gamepad)
* Issue 138 (Can't B out of mission briefing)

Also, I forgot to give an explanation of the gamepad controls with
yesterday's release.  If you're interested in using a gamepad, please
refer to `Ares Central's gamepad guide`_.  I've only tested a 360
controller myself, so your mileage may vary.
