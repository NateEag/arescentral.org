==================

Great news just in: another Ambrosia classic has received an open source
release. As of this week, Avara_ is now `available as open source`_.
There's a lot of work that goes into creating a playable game from that
(it took a year for Antares) but releasing the code is the first step.

If you've got the time, also check out the `20th Anniversary
Livestream`_.

To my knowledge, there are now three Ambrosia games from the MacOS
Classic era that have been open-sourced:

*   Avara_, since 2016.

*   Maelstrom_, the oldest of the bunch, `since 1999`_ (17 years!). The
    data files have also been freely available since 2010.

*   And of course, Ares, since 2008.

Aside from that, there are a couple of other projects in the open source
community based on old Ambrosia games:

*   `Endless Sky`_ is an EV_-alike that I enjoyed playing through. While
    it introduces some new gameplay systems to distinguish itself
    (power! heat!) it really captured for me a lot of what I enjoyed
    about the original.

*   delvmod_ is a set of tools for modding Cythera_. The official
    release of Cythera was complete (but buggy) and had a mod patcher
    (but no tool for mod creation). delvmod has already been used to fix
    the fishing and Fetch bugs.
