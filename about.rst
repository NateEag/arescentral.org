About
=====

Ares is a tactical space-combat game, combining elements of both arcade
shooters and real-time strategy games.

History
-------

Ares was written by Nathan Lamont of `Bigger Planet`_ for the classic
Mac OS and was originally published by Changeling Software. Changeling
Software went out of business while launching the game in 1998, and the
game was later released as shareware by `Ambrosia Software`_. Ambrosia
saw through another generation of the game, including the release of a
tool for creating plugins, called Hera, in 2001. However, following the
release of Mac OS X, the game languished on the outdated Classic
platform.

In November 2008, with the permission of Ambrosia, Nathan Lamont
released the source code of the game as open-source software under the
|gpl2|, later expanded to provide the option of the |lgpl3|.  In
addition, much of the media was released under Creative Commons
licenses. This led to the creation of two projects aiming to bring the
Ares experience back: `Xsera`_, a complete reimplementation which uses
the original game as a reference, and :doc:`antares`, which is a direct
port of the old game.

Open source release
-------------------

The `Ares source code`_ is licensed under the |gpl2| and the |lgpl3|.
This code forms the spriritual basis for `Xsera`_, and is directly
adapted in :doc:`antares`.

The `Ares media`_ (text, images, sounds, and music) are distributed
separately from the game engine and are licensed under the
|cc-by-nc-sa|. Not all media from the original commercial distribution
is included. Some sounds have been intentionally excluded.

In addition, the `Ares movies`_ are licensed under a more restrictive
|cc-by-nc-nd|.

Also available: the `Hera source code`_, game data editor for Ares. Most
of the Hera source files have been dedicated to the |pd|.
