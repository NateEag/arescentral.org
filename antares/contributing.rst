Contributing to Antares
=======================

There are plenty of ways to help out with Antares:

* Play the game!  Report bugs in our `issue tracker`_.  You're most
  likely to uncover bugs if you do things the game doesn't expect, so
  try winning (or losing) levels in unusual ways.
* Join the `development mailing list`_ to discuss bugs and feature
  requests.
* Join the `#antares IRC channel`_ on Ambrosia's IRC server.
* Grab the source code and start hacking.  Contribute back patches to
  fix problems and implement new behavior.
